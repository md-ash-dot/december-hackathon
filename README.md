### **🎄 Criteria**

- 🎁 **The project fits the theme of celebrating the holidays.**  
  The "12 Days of Christmas" is the period in Christian theology that marks the span between the birth of Christ and the coming of the three wise men. It begins on Christmas and runs to the Epiphany (6th January). We have decided to celebrate the "12 Days of Code-mas!"

- 🎁 **The project is well planned and executed (Using GitHub Projects/Kanban).**
  We utilised a [project board](https://github.com/users/md-ash-dot/projects/8/views/1?layout=board) on [GitHub](https://github.com/md-ash-dot/december-hackathon) in order to plan our tasks and stay organised with the project. We also communicated well on Slack throughout the Hackathon time period.

- 🎁 **The project has a basic README that follows the provided template.**
  Please refer to the current README.

- 🎁 **The project has an overall sense of completeness.**  
  We are happy with the project we have produced. We have a homepage (index.html) with Bootstrap cards which lead to different holiday themed animations and interactive games to get you into the holiday spirit!

- 🎁 **The project showcases a strong sense of creativity and originality.**  
  Each team member was responsible for two days and were delighted by the opportunity to showcase our individual creative thoughts and ideas. We showcased our ideas regularly on Slack and were very supportive of each other. We think that the 12 Days of Code-mas is an original idea as most people don't realise that the 12 days begins on Christmas day - we are not an Advent Calendar!

## **🎅 About the Submission**

### **Intro**

When you enter our site, you are greeted with twelve cards: 1 - 12. Behind each day is a different holiday based animation or interactive task. The idea is that each day represents the "12 days of Code-mas". Come back each day for holiday fun!

---

### **Goal**

- 🎄 **Problem Statement:**
  Once it gets to Christmas, people can get a bit blue that it's all over but the 12 Days of Code-mas extends the joy until the Epiphany! (6th January)
- 🎄 **Objective(s):**
  Our project aims to bring festive joy to people over the festive period.
- 🎄 **Target Audience:**
  Any age group can appreciate the 12 Days of Code-mas. Young children would probably need some assistance from an adult with the games.
- 🎄 **Benefits:**
  The games are replayable so you can return as often as you like to feel holiday joy! The animations are bright and cheerful - perfect for if you are sitting at your desk and want a pick-me up!
